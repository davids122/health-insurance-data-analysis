# Health Insurance Data Analysis


## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis on health insurance rates in the United States. I examined the percentage of people in each state aged 19-34 that have at least one form of health insurance based on data from 2020. I used the American Community Survey API for my health insurance data and the 'Tigris' library for the spatial data. I wrangled the data, performed a table join with the spatial layer, and mapped the results to decipher if any spatial trends were present. I calculated a Morans I to see if spatial autocorrelation was present. I then looked at local spatial autocorrelation using a LISA analysis. Doing this project was a great learning experience for me. I was able to apply tools I have learned in my classes to a personal project that I found both interesting and engaging.
